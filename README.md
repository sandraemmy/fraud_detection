# Group Mambers
- Prince Boateng

## Project Overview ##
The project focuses on fraud detection and risk assessment in insurance claims. The primary objectives are:
- Fraud Detection – Identifying fraudulent claims efficiently to minimize financial losses.
- Risk Assessment – Analyzing patterns in incidents and claims to improve risk evaluation and resource allocation.
The dataset includes customer demographics, policy details, incident information, and claims data, with a specific fraud_reported variable for fraud detection.

## Hypothesis ##
- Fraudulent claims may be more frequent in certain age groups and specific locations.
- Incidents might be more common during certain times, such as rush hours or late evenings.

## Challenges and Solutions ##
- Missing Data – Handled using statistical methods.
- Inconsistent Formats – Standardized date/time formats.
- Duplicate Entries – Identified and removed.


## Key Findings ##
- High claim amounts often correlate with higher fraud likelihood.
- Fraud detection models can help insurers adjust policies dynamically.
- Risk-based pricing models can be implemented to charge higher premiums for high-risk customers while offering discounts to low-risk customers.

## Conclusion ##
- Developing a machine learning model to predict fraud can improve detection efficiency.
- Dynamic pricing models can enhance profitability by attracting low-risk customers.
- Insurance claims exhibit randomness, making precise predictions challenging.

# Major Obstacle
Difficulty in importing data into an SQL database, which highlighted the importance of matching data types.
